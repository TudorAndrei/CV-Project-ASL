# ASL Project

## Description

ASL project is an educational software, intended for individuals learning American Sign Language, that will allow them to master the basic spelling and will facilitate the communication, as well as the integration, of deaf people.

## Idea

Learning ASL allows you to communicate with a wide range of hearing, hard of hearing, and deaf human beingsâ€”including those from hospitals, schools/colleges, courts, governmental agencies, community activities, and local, county, state legislatures.

## The goal

The main goal of the ASL project is to improve the quality of communication for hearing people with deaf or hard of hearing individuals, by helping learners to practice and to develop fluency in Sign Language.
